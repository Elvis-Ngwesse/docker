Common Log Files to Check for Generic Apps
-----------------------------------------

If your app is generic or doesn’t have dedicated logs, check these files:

- /var/log/messages
- /var/log/secure
- /var/log/cron           (for scheduled tasks)
- /var/log/firewalld/     (firewall logs if network issues suspected)

Differences Between RedHat and Debian Logs
------------------------------------------

Aspect               | RedHat                      | Debian
-------------------- | ---------------------------|-----------------------
General system logs   | /var/log/messages           | /var/log/syslog
Authentication logs   | /var/log/secure             | /var/log/auth.log
Mail server           | Postfix or Sendmail         | Exim4

Useful journalctl Commands (for systemd-based systems)
------------------------------------------------------

View detailed and recent logs (with explanations, at the end):
$ sudo journalctl -xe

View all journal logs:
$ sudo journalctl

View logs for a specific service (e.g., nginx):
$ journalctl -u nginx.service

View logs since a specific time:
$ journalctl --since "2025-05-28 14:00:00"

View only error priority logs:
$ journalctl -p err

Follow logs live (like tail -f):
$ journalctl -f

---

Viewing Logs by User
-------------------

To view logs generated by a specific user:

1. Find the user’s numeric UID (replace student1 with your username):
   $ id -u student1

2. Use the UID to filter logs in journalctl (example UID 1002):
   $ journalctl _UID=1002
